Project: Build a RESTful API for a Blogging Platform
Overview: Build a RESTful API for a blogging platform that allows users to create, read,
update, and delete blog posts. The API should also support user authentication and
authorization, allowing users to create and manage their own posts.

Requirements:
Level 1:

- Build a RESTful API using either Node.js or PHP
- Implement CRUD operations for blog posts
- Allow users to authenticate using either JWT or OAuth2.0

Level 2:

- Enforce authorization rules to ensure that users can only create and manage their own
  posts
- Use a database to store and retrieve blog post data (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB, or
  PostgreSQL)
- Version the API using a URL or header parameter
- Handle errors and provide appropriate error messages and status codes

Level 3:

- Implement security measures to protect against common security threats such as SQL
  injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks
- Optimize the API for scalability and performance, able to handle a large number of
  requests and traffic

Level 4:

- Include appropriate documentation using tools such as Swagger or Postman to
  provide a clear and concise overview of the API, its endpoints, parameters, and
  responses.

Due date: 04:00 pm 23rd, May 2023.
